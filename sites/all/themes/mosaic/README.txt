The Mosaic theme is the main user facing theme of Coral Nexus.

It is a fluid grid panels everywhere theme with a (typically) fixed width.
The theme uses SASS for compiling css. See the config.rb file in the drupal-cn
root to see the configurations.

All images and other media should be stored in a subfolder in assets.

All js and scss should be attached at end points within the site whenever
possible.  This is to ensure that our js and css remain easy to broswe and
simple to determine if needed.
